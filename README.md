### 🧬 Overview
This repository contains the materials, code, and references developed for the Master's thesis:  
**“Advanced study of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of neoplasms.”**

The work aims to explore the relationship between **epigenetic alterations** (such as DNA methylation patterns) and **tumorigenesis**, combining biological literature review with computational analysis.
