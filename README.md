### üß¨ Overview
This repository contains the materials, code, and references developed for the Master's thesis:  
**‚ÄúAdvanced study of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of neoplasms.‚Äù**

The work aims to explore the relationship between **epigenetic alterations** (such as DNA methylation patterns) and **tumorigenesis**, combining biological literature review with computational analysis.

### üß† Thesis Structure

The overall structure of the thesis is still being refined as the research evolves, but the main framework is already outlined. The project currently follows these key components:

1. **Biological and Medical Introduction** ‚Äì providing the theoretical and biomedical background necessary to contextualize the problem from a clinical perspective.
2. **Dataset Description and Data Exploration** ‚Äì presenting the dataset (GSE69914) and performing an exploratory analysis to understand its characteristics and potential biases.
3. **Data Pre-processing** ‚Äì applying statistical and normalization techniques to ensure data quality and comparability across samples.
4. **Algorithmic Analysis** ‚Äì implementing statistical and computational methods to identify biologically significant CpG sites associated with breast cancer.
5. **Work in Progress** ‚Äì further model refinement, interpretation of results, and integration with biological insights will follow.
